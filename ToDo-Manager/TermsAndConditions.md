# Terms and Conditions

**Last updated: November 24, 2025**

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the "Todo Manager" mobile application (the "App") operated by Crisnat Foundations ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.

By downloading or using the App, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the App.

## 1. License and Intellectual Property

We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the App strictly in accordance with these Terms.

You are not allowed to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn't try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Crisnat Foundations.

## 2. User Restrictions

You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:
* License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the App or make the App available to any third party.
* Remove, alter or obscure any proprietary notice (including any notice of copyright or trademark) of Crisnat Foundations or its affiliates, partners, suppliers or the licensors of the App.
* Use the App for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.
* Use the App to harass, abuse, or harm another person or group, or attempt to do so.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. If you use these third-party services within the App, you are subject to their respective terms.
The App may also contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

## 4. App Operation and Connection

You should be aware that there are certain things that Crisnat Foundations will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but [Your Company/Developer Name] cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

Along the same lines, Crisnat Foundations cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Crisnat Foundations cannot accept responsibility.

## 5. Updates and Availability

We are committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on Android – the requirements for system(s) (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Crisnat Foundations does not promise that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device.

We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CRISNAT FOUNDATIONS, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE APP, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, WE PROVIDE NO WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING, AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND THAT THE APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULTS, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, MEET ANY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY STANDARDS OR BE ERROR FREE OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CRISNAT FOUNDATIONS OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND/OR THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE USED WITH THE APP, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT), EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
