## Privacy Policy for Realtime Speedometer

**Last updated: January 11, 2026**

**Crisnat Foundations** ("we," "our," or "us") operates the **Realtime Speedometer** mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way, unless explicitly stated below.

#### A. Location Data (GPS)

Our App's primary function is to display your current speed. To do this, we require access to your device's **Location Services (GPS)**.

* **How we use it:** The App reads your location coordinates in real-time to calculate your movement speed and display it on the speedometer (in km/h or mph).
* **Data Retention:** This location data is processed locally on your device in real-time. We **do not** transmit your location history to any external servers, nor do we store your travel history.

#### B. Advertising Data

To support the development and maintenance of this App, we may display third-party advertisements (banners) at the bottom of the screen. We use **Google AdMob** to serve these ads.

* AdMob and its partners may use device identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID), cookies, and general location data (coarse location) to provide personalized or non-personalized advertising.

### 2. Third-Party Service Providers

The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### 3. Log Data

We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the App (like a crash), we may collect data and information (through third-party products like Google Play Console) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

### 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information. Since our App processes your precise speed location data locally on your device, the risk of data leakage is minimal. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 5. Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites (via advertisements). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
