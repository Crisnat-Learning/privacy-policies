## 1\. Health Warning: Photosensitive Epilepsy

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**

The "Disco Mode" and "Shake-to-Wake" features of this application utilize the device's LED flash to produce rapid strobing or flashing light effects.

A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while using this application, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.

**By using this application, you acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks associated with the use of flashing lights.** We strongly advise that you do not use the "Disco Mode" or strobe features near anyone with a history of epilepsy or seizure disorders. If you, or anyone around you, experience any of the following symptoms while using the app—dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions—**IMMEDIATELY** discontinue use and consult a physician.
