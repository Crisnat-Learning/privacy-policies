# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 07, 2025**

**Crisnat Foundations** built the **Smart Torch with Disco Party** app as a free app with optional in-app purchases. This SERVICE is provided by Crisnat Foundations at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.

### Specific Permissions and Data Usage

To provide the features described in the application, **Smart Torch with Disco Party** requires specific permissions to access hardware on your device. We are transparent about why we need these permissions:

#### 1\. Camera (`android.permission.CAMERA`)

*   **Purpose:** This permission is strictly required to control the device's **LED Flashlight** (Torch).
    
*   **Data Usage:** We do **not** take photos, record videos, or access the camera preview for image capture. The camera sensor is only accessed to toggle the hardware flash on and off. No image data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
    

#### 2\. Microphone / Record Audio (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`)

*   **Purpose:** This permission is required for the **Disco Mode** feature.
    
*   **Data Usage:** The app listens to ambient audio to synchronize the flashlight with the rhythm of the music.
    
*   **Privacy:** The audio data is processed locally on your device in real-time to calculate amplitude levels. **We do not record, save, upload, or transmit any audio data.** The raw audio stream is discarded immediately after the light intensity is calculated.
    

#### 3\. Foreground Service (`android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)

*   **Purpose:** The app uses background services to ensure the Disco Mode continues running even when you lock your screen or use other apps.
    
*   **Data Usage:** This allows the app to maintain a `WAKE_LOCK` to keep the CPU running for these specific features. You will see a persistent notification when these services are active.
    

#### 4\. Sensors (Accelerometer)

*   **Purpose:** Used for the **Shake-to-Wake** feature.
    
*   **Data Usage:** We access the device's accelerometer to detect shake gestures. This data is processed locally to trigger the flashlight and is not stored or shared.
